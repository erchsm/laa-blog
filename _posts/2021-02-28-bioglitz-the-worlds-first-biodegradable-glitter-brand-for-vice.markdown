Saba Gray is the founder and CEO of sustainable glitter company, BioGlitz. After years of working in fashion, Saba recognized that her love of plastic-based glitter was killing the planet. She then spent years working with natural ingredients to discover what became an cellulose-based product that is as beautiful as it is sustainable. Watch as we tag along to a photoshoot to see BioGlitz in action.
