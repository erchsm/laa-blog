“For those of you who don’t know, I’ve had trichotillomania (a compulsive hair-pulling disorder) since I was in middle school. Trichotillomania caused me to pull my hair out so frequently that I was nearly bald before I even entered high school. By then I was wearing hats and wigs to cover my scalp, but they couldn’t hide the shame. My pulling increased. I didn’t feel comfortable talking about my affliction with anyone––including myself––at the time, so I let the negative feelings and urges fester for years.”
